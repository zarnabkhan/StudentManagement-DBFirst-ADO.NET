# StudentManagement-DBFirst-ADO.NET
Student Management System built using SQL Server, Stored Procedures, and ADO.NET following the DB-First approach.

Overview
This project is a **Student Management System** built using **DB-First approach**, **ADO.NET**, and **SQL Server Stored Procedures**.  
The database is designed manually in SQL Server, and the application interacts with it using raw SQL and stored procedures.


Technologies Used
- C#
- .NET
- ADO.NET
- SQL Server Express
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- Stored Procedures
- Visual Studio

Features
- Add a student using stored procedures
- View student records
- Delete a student
- Database-first design
- Secure database interaction using SQL parameters

Project Structure
- SQL Scripts – Tables & stored procedures
- ADO.NET connection logic
- Console-based UI
- Program.cs – Application entry point

How It Works (DB-First)
1. Database and tables are created manually in SQL Server
2. Stored procedures handle database logic
3. ADO.NET connects C# to SQL Server
4. CRUD operations are executed using stored procedures

How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open SQL scripts in SSMS and execute them
3. Update the connection string in the project
4. Run the console application in Visual Studio


Learning Outcomes
- Understanding DB-First architecture
- Writing and executing stored procedures
- Using ADO.NET with SQL Server
- Managing SQL connections safely

Fun Fact
This project avoids ORMs completely and works directly with SQL
